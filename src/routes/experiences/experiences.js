        working as a retail assistant at Michael Hill has been incredibly valuable. </p><br>
        <p>Despite previously serving as an investment product advisor, I later 
        realized a gap in my skills pertaining to customer engagement and 
        communication, particularly in a Western setting, possibly due to cultural 
        differences. </p><br>
        <p> Consequently, I encountered challenges in expressing my 
        ideas and showcasing my true capability, hindering my ability to be an 
        engaging coworker during my other tenures or Uni life. </p><br>
        <p>However, my time 
        as a retail assistant provided me with invaluable insights. I gained a 
        deeper understanding of effective customer interaction, tailored to the 
        preferences of New Zealanders. </p><br>
        <p> Moreover, I honed my teamwork skills in 
        the fast-paced retail environment, learned to cultivate customer loyalty, 
        and even delved into the art of storytelling in the context of luxury 
        jewelry.</p>`,

        Zealand, I had to pause my studies and found an internship in my 
        hometown of Nanning, China, at YingLing Asset, a small-sized asset 
        management company initially managing around 50 million RMB in assets 
        under management (AUM). </p><br>
        <p> I started as an Investment Analyst Intern and 
        later, due to the company's expansion needs, its funds outperformed 
        benchmarks and my exemplary performance during the internship, I was 
        appointed by the CEO to be an Investment Product Advisor (a sales role in 
        asset management). </p><br>
        <p>Ultimately, I helped drive the company's AUM up by 
        50 million RMB (equivalent to 11 million NZD based on the 10-year average 
        NZD/RMB exchange rate). By the time I left the company, the AUM reached 
        220 million RMB. The tasks I performed in this role are summarized below: </p><br>
